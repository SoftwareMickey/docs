## Overview

**VectorIHub** is a cloud hosting and deployment platform engineered to bridge the gap between development and production. By leveraging **Auto-Dockerization**, we eliminate the need for manual Dockerfile configuration, allowing you to focus on writing code while we handle the containerization, orchestration, and scaling.

## How It Works

VectorIHub analyzes your repository to determine the best environment for your application. No more `EXPOSE` or `WORKDIR` headaches.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect your Repository">
    Link your GitHub or GitLab account to VectorIHub.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Pattern Detection">
    Our engine scans your code for framework signatures (e.g., `package.json`, `go.mod`).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Build & Deploy">
    We generate a secure, optimized Docker image and deploy it to our global edge network.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  VectorIHub currently provides a **Trial Tier** with no credit card required. You can deploy your first project in under 2 minutes.

Frequently Asked Questions
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do I need to know Docker to use VectorIHub?">
    Not at all. VectorIHub handles the creation, layering, and optimization of your containers. However, if you have a custom Dockerfile, we’ll respect and use it.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens during production updates?">
    We utilize Blue-Green deployments by default. Your old version stays live until the new container passes health checks, ensuring zero downtime.
  </Accordion>

<Update label="New Feature" date="February 2026">
  Added native support for React runtimes.

## Core Platform Benefits

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Speed to Market" icon="rocket">
  Traditional DevOps requires manual environment setup, which can take hours or even days. With VectorIHub, the transition from git push to a live URL happens in minutes.

  * **Instant CI/CD:** Built-in pipelines triggered automatically by your git commits.
  * **Pattern Detection:** Automatic recognition of Node.js, Python, and Go project structures to eliminate manual config.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Built-in Reliability" icon="shield-check">
  We provide an "opinionated" infrastructure that follows industry best practices for security and uptime, so you don't have to be a SRE expert.

  * **Zero-Downtime Deploys:** Automatic blue-green deployments ensure your app stays online during updates.
  * **Health Monitoring:** Intelligent, self-healing containers that automatically restart if they crash or become unresponsive.

## Deep Dive: Advanced Advantages

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Optimized Resource Isolation">
  Every application runs in its own isolated container. This prevents "noisy neighbor" syndrome and ensures that a memory leak in one service doesn't crash your entire cluster.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Security First Architecture">
  VectorIHub automatically applies security patches to the base images we use for auto-dockerization. You get enterprise-grade security without having to audit your own base OS.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Developer Experience (DX)">
  We prioritize the developer. From our intuitive dashboard, everything is designed to reduce cognitive load and prevent "DevOps burnout."
