<Update label="February 2026" description="v1.0.0 Release">
  VectorIHub is officially live! We've moved beyond the "minty" experimental phases to a full-scale deployment engine.
</Update>

## The Future of AI Deployment

VectorIHub is a powerful **auto-dockerization and deployment platform**. We’ve built this to bridge the gap between writing great AI code and actually getting it into production.
