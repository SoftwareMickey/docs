## Welcome to VectorIHub

VectorIHub is a cloud development and deployment platform that allows developers to deploy any application stack directly from GitHub to a live environment in minutes.

Instead of manually configuring Docker, servers, networking, and domains, VectorIHub automates the entire lifecycle:
- Repository cloning
- Stack detection (Node, Go, Python, Rust, etc.)
- Auto-dockerization
- Image building & container deployment
- Domain routing and SSL provisioning

This enables developers to focus on shipping code while VectorIHub handles infrastructure orchestration behind the scenes.

## Core Philosophy

VectorIHub is built around one core idea:

> Make deployment as simple as pushing code.

Whether you are deploying a frontend app, backend API, full-stack project, or microservices architecture, VectorIHub intelligently prepares the runtime environment and launches your containerized application on VHB Cloud.

## How VectorIHub Works

The VectorIHub deployment pipeline follows a streamlined flow:

1. Connect your GitHub repository  
2. VectorIHub clones and analyzes your project
3. The platform detects the programming language and runtime
4. An optimized Docker image is generated automatically
5. The container is deployed to a live environment
6. A public URL and optional custom domain are provisioned

This process typically takes a few minutes and requires zero manual infrastructure setup.

## Key Features

### One-Click GitHub Deployments
Deploy any public or private repository directly to production without writing Dockerfiles manually.

### Auto Dockerization Engine
VectorIHub automatically generates production-ready Docker configurations for multiple programming languages and frameworks.

### VectorIHub Domains & Custom Domains
Each deployment is assigned a live domain with optional custom domain support, DNS verification, and SSL management.

### Multi-Environment Support
Deploy across development, staging, and production environments using VectorIHub Multi Env for safe testing and CI/CD workflows.

### Resource-Based Deployment
With VectorIHub Resource, multiple containers can run within a shared resource pool for efficient compute usage.
