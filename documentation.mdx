## Welcome to VectorIHub

VectorIHub is a cloud development and deployment platform that eliminates the "it works on my machine" headache. We bridge the gap between your GitHub repository and a live production environment.

    No more manual Dockerfile writing. We detect your stack and containerize it for you.

## The VectorIHub Pipeline

Instead of manually managing servers, VectorIHub automates the entire infrastructure lifecycle:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect">
    Link your GitHub repository (Public or Private) to the VectorIHub dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Analyze">
    Our engine clones your project and intelligently detects the runtime (Node, Go, Python, Rust, etc.).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Build & Deploy">
    We generate an optimized Docker image, build it, and launch your container on **VHB Cloud**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Live">
    Your application is provisioned with a public URL, SSL certificate, and optional custom domain.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Core Philosophy

> **Make deployment as simple as pushing code.**
> 
> Whether you are deploying a frontend app, backend API, or complex microservices, VectorIHub orchestrates the infrastructure so you can focus on shipping.
