### Deploying a React App

<div style={{ fontSize: "16px" }}>
    VectorIHub makes deploying your React apps effortless.  
    Once your code is pushed to GitHub (or uploaded directly), VectorIHub will **auto detect the framework**, run the production build, and host the optimized static bundle for you — **no Dockerfile or server setup required**.
</div>

<Note>
VectorIHub automatically scans your repository to detect React frameworks like Vite, Create React App, and other static frontend setups.

## Project Requirements

Before deploying, ensure your React project meets the following requirements:

<Columns>
  <Column>
    <Check>Includes a `package.json` file</Check>
    <Check>Has a valid build script (`npm run build`)</Check>
    <Check>Uses a supported React setup (Vite, CRA, or similar)</Check>
  </Column>
  <Column>
    <Info>
      Supported setups include:
      <br />• Vite + React  
      • Create React App  
      • Static build outputs (`dist/` or `build/`)
    </Info>
  </Column>
</Columns>

<Tip>
For best compatibility, ensure your production build outputs to a `dist` or `build` folder.
</Tip>

### Example Project Structure

```bash
my-react-app/
├── package.json
├── index.html
├── src/
│   ├── main.jsx
│   └── App.jsx
└── vite.config.js
```

## Deployment Workflow

<Steps> 
    <Step title="Push Your Project"> Push your React project to GitHub or upload it directly via the VectorIHub dashboard. </Step> 

    <CodeGroup>
        ```bash Git (Recommended)
            git init
            git add .
            git commit -m "first commit"
            git branch -M main
            git remote add origin https://github.com/username/my-app.git
            git push -u origin main
            ```
            ```bash Direct Upload
            # Upload your project zip file from the VectorIHub dashboard
            # VectorIHub will automatically extract and analyze the codebase
            ```
    </CodeGroup>

    <Check>Your repository is now ready for automatic framework detection.</Check>

    <Step title="Connect to VectorIHub"> Navigate to the VectorIHub dashboard and connect your repository. </Step> 
        <CardGroup cols={1}> 
            <Card title="Deploy Repo" icon="github"> Import directly from GitHub or GitLab. </Card> 
            <Card title="Code Scan" icon="scan-line"> VectorIHub scans your codebase for React configs and build scripts. </Card> 
        </CardGroup> 
        <Note> The platform automatically detects frameworks like Vite and CRA by analyzing `package.json` and build configurations. </Note> 

    <Step title="Build & Deploy"> VectorIHub handles the entire build pipeline automatically. </Step> 
    <AccordionGroup> 
        <Accordion title="Dependency Installation"> Installs dependencies using `npm install`, `yarn install`, or `pnpm install` based on your lockfile. </Accordion> 
        <Accordion title="Framework Detection"> Detects your React framework and build configuration automatically. </Accordion> 
        <Accordion title="Production Build"> Runs the production build command (e.g. `npm run build`) to generate optimized static assets. </Accordion> 
        <Accordion title="Containerized Hosting"> Serves the built `dist/` or `build/` folder inside a secure production container. </Accordion> 
    </AccordionGroup>

    <Check>No server configuration or Dockerfile required</Check>

    <Step title="Access Your App"> Once deployment is complete, VectorIHub provides a live URL for your application. </Step> 
    <Frame> 
        ```arduino 
            https://my-react-app.vectorihub.run 
        ``` 
    </Frame> 

    <Info> Your React app is now globally accessible with automatic routing, caching, and secure hosting. </Info> 
</Steps>

## Common Tips for Smooth Deployment

<Tabs> 
    <Tab title="Best Practices"> 
        <Tip>Keep your `package.json` in the root directory.</Tip> 
        <Tip>Ensure a valid `build` script exists in your project.</Tip> 
        <Tip>Use environment variables for API endpoints instead of hardcoding URLs.</Tip> 
    </Tab> 
    <Tab title="Troubleshooting"> 
        <Warning> If the build fails, ensure `npm run build` works locally before deploying. </Warning>
        <Error> Missing `package.json` or build script may cause automatic detection to fail. </Error> 
    </Tab>

Summary
<Check> With VectorIHub, deploying a React app is as simple as pushing your code. The platform auto-detects the framework, installs dependencies, builds the project, and hosts the optimized frontend globally with zero configuration. </Check>
