# Supported React App Types

VectorIHub automatically detects and deploys your React applications by scanning your repository for common frontend project structures.  
Unlike backend runtimes, React apps do not require manual port configuration — VectorIHub builds your app and serves the optimized production bundle automatically.

<Note>
Automatic detection works best when your project includes a valid `package.json` with a build script such as `npm run build`.

## 1. Vite + React (Recommended)

Modern React apps built with **Vite** are fully supported and automatically optimized for fast production builds and static serving.

<Check>
This is the fastest and most optimized React deployment pattern on VectorIHub.
</Check>

<CodeGroup>
```jsx main.jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import App from "./App.jsx";

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```
</CodeGroup>

## 2. Create React App (CRA)

VectorIHub automatically detects Create React App projects and runs the correct build process without additional configuration.

<Tip> Ensure your `package.json` contains a valid `build` script (e.g. `react-scripts build`) for automatic detection. </Tip> 

<CodeGroup> 
  ```json package.json 
  { 
    "scripts": { 
      "start": "react-scripts start", 
      "build": "react-scripts build" 
    } 
  } 
  ``` 
</CodeGroup>

## 3. Static React Builds (Dist / Build Folder)

If your React project outputs a static build folder (such as dist/ or build/), VectorIHub automatically serves it through a secure container and global routing layer.

<Info> This works seamlessly with custom React setups, Vite exports, and other static frontend configurations. </Info> 

<CodeGroup> 
```bash 
  npm run build # Output: # dist/ or build/ 
  ```
