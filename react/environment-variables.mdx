# Managing Environment Variables

Modern React applications rely on API endpoints, feature flags, and third-party integrations.  
VectorIHub allows you to securely manage these using **environment variables** — without exposing sensitive data in your repository.

<Note>
Environment variables are securely injected during the build and deployment process and are not stored in your source code.
</Note>

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Secure by Default" icon="shield">
    Keep API keys and configs out of your GitHub repository.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Build-Time Injection" icon="cpu">
    Variables are injected during the build process for React apps.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Zero Config Access" icon="zap">
    Access variables instantly using `import.meta.env` or framework-specific env access.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Adding Environment Variables

Follow these steps to add environment variables to your React project:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Project Dashboard">
    Go to your project inside the **VectorIHub Dashboard**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Navigate to Environment Settings">
    Open:
    <Info>Settings → Environment Variables</Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Key-Value Pairs">
    Add your environment variables such as API URLs, public keys, or feature flags.

    ```bash
    Key: VITE_API_URL
    Value: https://api.vectorihub.com
    ```

    <Check>
    Your variables are now securely stored and will be injected during the build.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Accessing Variables in React (Vite)

For Vite-based React apps, environment variables are accessed using `import.meta.env`.

<CodeGroup>
```jsx App.jsx
const apiUrl = import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL;

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>VectorIHub React App 🚀</h1>
      <p>API Endpoint: {apiUrl}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip> Vite requires environment variables to be prefixed with `VITE_` to be exposed to the browser. </Tip>

## Accessing Variables in Create React App (CRA)

If you are using Create React App, use the REACT_APP_ prefix.

<CodeGroup> 
  ```jsx App.js 
  const apiUrl = process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL;

  function App() {
    return (
    <div>
    <h1>Connected to: {apiUrl}</h1>
    </div>
    );
  }

  export default App;
  ```
</CodeGroup>


## Best Practices

<Columns>
  <Column>
    <Check>Never commit API keys or secrets to GitHub</Check>
    <Check>Use environment variables for all external endpoints</Check>
    <Check>Separate development and production variables</Check>
  </Column>
  <Column>
    <Warning>
      Exposing private secrets in frontend apps can lead to security risks. Only use public-safe keys in React.
    </Warning>
  </Column>
</Columns>

## Updating Environment Variables

Environment variable updates are applied during the next deployment cycle.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How updates are applied">
    - Modify or add variables in the dashboard  
    - Trigger a redeploy or push new code  
    - VectorIHub rebuilds the React app with updated variables  
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="When should you redeploy?">
    Redeploy whenever you:
    - Change API endpoints  
    - Update public configuration values  
    - Add new third-party integrations  
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Badge color="amber">Requires Redeploy</Badge>

## Supported Use Cases

VectorIHub environment variables in React apps can be used for:

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="API Endpoints" icon="globe">
    Backend URLs, microservices, and gateway endpoints.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Public API Keys" icon="lock">
    Stripe public keys, analytics keys, and other client-safe tokens.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Feature Flags" icon="settings">
    Enable or disable features across environments.
  </Card>
  <Card title="App Configuration" icon="sliders">
    Environment modes, branding configs, and runtime settings.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Summary

<Check>
Store configuration safely in the VectorIHub dashboard and access it in your React app using `import.meta.env` (Vite) or `process.env` (CRA).
</Check>

<Expandable title="Quick Recap">
- Add variables in **Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables**  
- Use `VITE_` (Vite) or `REACT_APP_` (CRA) prefixes  
- Redeploy to apply changes  
- Never store secrets directly in frontend code
