## Deployment Process

Follow these steps to get your React application live on VectorIHub.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect Repository">
    Upload or connect your GitHub/GitLab repository. VectorIHub scans your codebase and detects React configurations automatically.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Build & Environment Setup">
    VectorIHub automatically:
    * Detects React frameworks (Vite, Create React App, etc.)
    * Installs dependencies using `npm`, `yarn`, or `pnpm`
    * Runs the production build (`npm run build`)
    * Optimizes static assets for fast delivery
  </Step>

  <Step title="Go Live">
    VectorIHub builds your React app and serves the optimized production bundle through a secure container and global edge routing.

    <Check>Most React deployments complete in under 60 seconds.</Check>
  </Step>
