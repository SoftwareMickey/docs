# Managing Environment Variables

Most real-world applications rely on API keys, database connections, and third-party services.  
VectorIHub makes it easy to manage these securely using **environment variables** — so you never have to store secrets in your codebase.

<Note>
Environment variables are securely injected into your runtime during deployment and are never exposed in your repository.
</Note>

  <Card title="Secure by Default" icon="shield">
    Keep secrets out of your GitHub repository.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Runtime Injection" icon="cpu">
    Variables are automatically injected into your app at runtime.

## Adding Environment Variables

Follow these steps to add environment variables to your project:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Project Dashboard">
    Go to your project inside the **VectorIHub Dashboard**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Navigate to Environment Settings">
    Open:
    <Info>Settings → Environment Variables</Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Key-Value Pairs">
    Add your environment variables such as database URLs, API keys, or service tokens.

    ```bash
    Key: DATABASE_URL
    Value: postgres://username:password@host:5432/mydb
    ```

    <Check>
    Your variables are now securely stored and ready for deployment.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Accessing Variables in Node.js

Once added, VectorIHub automatically injects environment variables into your runtime environment.  
You can access them in your application using `process.env`.

<CodeGroup>
```js server.js
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

const dbUrl = process.env.DATABASE_URL;

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send(`Connected to database: ${dbUrl}`);
});

app.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000, () => {
  console.log("Server running with env vars on VectorIHub 🚀");
});
```
</CodeGroup>

Best Practices
<Columns> 
    <Column> 
        <Check>Never commit secrets like API keys to GitHub</Check> 
        <Check>Use environment variables for all credentials</Check> 
        <Check>Add safe fallbacks for local development</Check> 
    </Column> 
    <Column> 
        <Warning> Hardcoding secrets in your code can expose sensitive data and create security risks. </Warning> 
    </Column> 
</Columns>

Updating Environment Variables

Environment variable updates are applied during the next deployment cycle.

<AccordionGroup> 
    <Accordion title="How updates are applied"> 
        - Modify or add variables in the dashboard 
        - Trigger a redeploy or push new code 
        - VectorIHub rebuilds the container with updated variables 
    </Accordion> 
    <Accordion title="When should you redeploy?"> 
        Redeploy whenever you: 
            - Change API keys 
            - Update database credentials 
            - Add new third-party integrations 
    </Accordion> 
</AccordionGroup>
