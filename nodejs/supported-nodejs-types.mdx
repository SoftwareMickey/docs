# Supported Node.js App Types

VectorIHub automatically detects and runs your Node.js apps by scanning for common runtime patterns in your codebase.  
You don’t need to configure ports manually — as long as your app follows one of the supported patterns below, VectorIHub handles port binding and runtime setup for you.

<Note>
Automatic port detection works best when your server explicitly calls `.listen(PORT)` or uses `process.env.PORT`.

## 1. Express.js (or Raw HTTP)

Most Node.js applications use **Express** or a raw HTTP server.  
VectorIHub automatically detects `.listen(PORT)` calls and binds the correct container port.

<Check>
This is the most common and fully optimized deployment pattern on VectorIHub.
</Check>

<CodeGroup>
```js server.js
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello from VectorIHub 🚀");
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server running on port 3000");
});
```
</CodeGroup>

---

## 2. Using process.env.PORT (Recommended)

If your app relies on dynamic environment ports (best practice for cloud deployments), VectorIHub supports it automatically.

<Tip> Always prefer `process.env.PORT` for maximum compatibility across environments. </Tip> 

<CodeGroup> 
```js server.js 

const express = require("express"); const app = express();

const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
res.send("Running on a VectorIHub-assigned port 🚀");
});

app.listen(port, () => {
console.log(Server running on port ${port});
});
```
</CodeGroup>


## 3. Fastify

VectorIHub detects Fastify servers that call `.listen(PORT)` and configures networking automatically.

<Info>
Fastify apps are optimized for high-performance workloads and are fully supported.
</Info>

<CodeGroup>
```js server.js
const fastify = require("fastify")();

fastify.get("/", async () => {
  return { message: "Hello from Fastify on VectorIHub" };
});

fastify.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Fastify running on port 3000");
});
```
