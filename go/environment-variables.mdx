# Managing Environment Variables

Most production Go applications rely on API keys, database connections, and third-party services.  
VectorIHub makes it easy to manage these securely using **environment variables** — so you never have to store secrets inside your Go codebase.

<Note>
Environment variables are securely injected into your runtime container during deployment and are never exposed in your repository.
</Note>

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Secure by Default" icon="shield">
    Keep secrets and credentials out of your GitHub repository.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Runtime Injection" icon="cpu">
    Variables are automatically injected into your Go app at runtime.

## Adding Environment Variables

Follow these steps to add environment variables to your Go project:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Project Dashboard">
    Go to your project inside the **VectorIHub Dashboard**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Navigate to Environment Settings">
    Open:
    <Info>Settings → Environment Variables</Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Key-Value Pairs">
    Add your environment variables such as database URLs, API keys, or service tokens.

    ```bash
    Key: DATABASE_URL
    Value: postgres://username:password@host:5432/mydb
    ```
    <Check>
    Your variables are now securely stored and ready for deployment.
    </Check>
  </Step> 
</Steps>

## Accessing Variables in Go

Once added, VectorIHub automatically injects environment variables into your runtime environment. 

You can access them in your Go application using the standard library `os` package.

<CodeGroup>
  ```go main.go
  package main

  import (
    "fmt"
    "net/http"
    "os"
  )

  func main() {
    // Accessing the environment variable
    dbURL := os.Getenv("DATABASE_URL")

    fmt.Println("Connected to:", dbURL)

    // Example: Using PORT for the server
    port := os.Getenv("PORT")
    if port == "" {
      port = "8080"
    }
    
    http.ListenAndServe(":" + port, nil)
  }
```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
Always use `os.Getenv("PORT")` for cloud deployments to ensure proper port binding on VectorIHub.
</Tip>

## Best Practices

<Columns>
  <Column>
    <Check>Never commit secrets like API keys to GitHub</Check>
    <Check>Use environment variables for all credentials</Check>
    <Check>Add safe fallbacks for local development</Check>
  </Column>
  <Column>
    <Warning>
      Hardcoding secrets in Go source files can expose sensitive data and create serious security risks.
    </Warning>
  </Column>

## Updating Environment Variables

Environment variable updates are applied during the next deployment cycle.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How updates are applied">
    - Modify or add variables in the dashboard  
    - Trigger a redeploy or push new code  
    - VectorIHub rebuilds and restarts your Go container with updated variables  
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="When should you redeploy?">
    Redeploy whenever you:
    - Change API keys  
    - Update database credentials  
    - Add new third-party integrations  
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Badge color="amber">Requires Redeploy</Badge>
