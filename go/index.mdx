## Deployment Process

Follow these steps to get your Go application live on VectorIHub.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect Repository">
    Upload or connect your GitHub/GitLab repository. VectorIHub scans your codebase to detect Go modules and entry files.

    <Tip>Ensure your `go.mod` and `main.go` are present for automatic runtime detection.</Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Build & Environment Setup">
    VectorIHub automatically:
    * Detects `go.mod` and Go module structure
    * Downloads dependencies using `go mod download`
    * Compiles your application into an optimized binary
    * Detects the Go version from your module settings
  </Step>

  <Step title="Go Live">
    VectorIHub builds and runs your compiled Go binary inside a secure container, automatically binding the correct port.

    <Check>Most Go deployments complete in under 60 seconds.</Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example: Deploying a Go HTTP Server

<CodeGroup>

```go main.go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"net/http"
	"os"
)

func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	fmt.Fprintln(w, "Hello from VectorIHub Go runtime 🚀")
}

func main() {
	port := os.Getenv("PORT")
	if port == "" {
		port = "8080"
	}

	http.HandleFunc("/", handler)
	fmt.Println("Server running on port", port)
	http.ListenAndServe(":"+port, nil)
}
```
