### Deploying a Go App

<div style={{ fontSize: "16px" }}>
    VectorIHub makes deploying your Go apps effortless.  
    Once your code is pushed to GitHub (or uploaded directly), VectorIHub will **auto detect your Go module**, compile the binary, and handle containerization for you — <strong>no Dockerfile required</strong>.
</div>

<Note>
VectorIHub automatically scans your repository to detect `go.mod`, `main.go`, and supported server patterns such as `http.ListenAndServe` and framework-based routers.

## Project Requirements

Before deploying, ensure your Go project meets the following requirements:

<Columns>
  <Column>
    <Check>Includes a `go.mod` file</Check>
    <Check>Has a `main.go` entry file</Check>
    <Check>Starts a server or executable in `main()`</Check>
  </Column>
  <Column>
    <Info>
      Supported patterns include:
      <br />• `http.ListenAndServe(":PORT", ...)`  
      • `os.Getenv("PORT")`  
      • `router.Run(":PORT")` (Gin)  
      • `app.Listen(":PORT")` (Fiber)  
    </Info>
  </Column>
</Columns>

<Tip>
For best cloud compatibility, use `os.Getenv("PORT")` instead of hardcoding ports.
</Tip>

### Example Project Structure

```bash
my-go-app/
├── go.mod
├── go.sum
├── main.go
└── internal/
    └── handlers.go
```
It looks like you've already got a solid structure there using Mintlify-style components! I’ve refined the syntax to ensure it follows standard MDX conventions for documentation, keeping the flow logical and the technical steps punchy.

## Go Deployment Workflow

Follow these steps to get your Go application live on VectorIHub in minutes.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Push Your Project">
        Push your Go project to GitHub or upload it directly via the VectorIHub dashboard.

        <CodeGroup>
            ```bash Git (Recommended)
            git init
            git add .
            git commit -m "first commit"
            git branch -M main
            git remote add origin https://github.com/username/my-go-app.git
            git push -u origin main
            ```
        </CodeGroup>

        ```bash Direct Upload
        # 1. Zip your project files
        # 2. Upload via the VectorIHub dashboard
        # 3. VectorIHub automatically extracts and analyzes the codebase
        ```

        <Check>Your repository is now ready for automatic Go runtime detection.</Check>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Connect to VectorIHub">
        Navigate to the VectorIHub dashboard and connect your repository to initiate the import.

        <CardGroup cols={2}>
            <Card title="Deploy Repo" icon="github">
                Import directly from GitHub or GitLab with seamless integration.
            </Card>
            <Card title="Code Scan" icon="scan-line">
                VectorIHub scans your codebase for `go.mod`, entry points, and server patterns.
            </Card>
        </CardGroup>

        <Note>
        The platform automatically detects supported patterns like `http.ListenAndServe`, Gin `Run()`, Echo `Start()`, and Fiber `Listen()`.
        </Note>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Build & Deploy">
        VectorIHub handles the entire Go build and deployment pipeline automatically.

        <AccordionGroup>
            <Accordion title="Dependency Resolution">
                Downloads Go dependencies using `go mod download` and `go mod tidy`.
            </Accordion>
            <Accordion title="Compilation">
                Compiles your application into a high-performance, optimized production binary.
            </Accordion>
            <Accordion title="Runtime Detection">
                Detects the main entry point and server startup logic in `main.go`.
            </Accordion>
            <Accordion title="Containerization">
                Packages the compiled binary into a secure, lightweight, and production-ready container.
            </Accordion>
            <Accordion title="Port Binding">
                Automatically binds the correct `PORT` environment variable—no manual configuration required.
            </Accordion>
        </AccordionGroup>

        <Check>No manual Dockerfile or build scripts required</Check>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Access Your App">
        Once deployment is complete, VectorIHub provides a live production URL for your application.
        <Frame>
            `https://my-go-app.vectorihub.run`
        </Frame>

        <Info>
        Your Go app is now publicly accessible, compiled, and securely hosted with automatic networking and routing.
        </Info>
    </Step>

## Common Tips for Smooth Deployment

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Best Practices">
    <Tip>Keep your `go.mod` in the root directory.</Tip>
    <Tip>Ensure your `main.go` contains the application entry point.</Tip>
    <Tip>Use `os.Getenv("PORT")` for production-ready deployments.</Tip>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Troubleshooting">
    <Warning>
      If your app exits immediately, ensure your `main()` function starts a server or long-running process.
    </Warning>
    <Error>
      Missing `go.mod` or `main.go` may cause runtime detection to fail.
    </Error>
  </Tab>

Summary

<Check>
With VectorIHub, deploying a Go app is as simple as pushing your code. The platform auto-detects your module, compiles the binary, containerizes the runtime, and deploys your application with zero configuration.
