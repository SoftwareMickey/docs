### Infrastructure Upgrades

We've overhauled our backend to ensure your applications stay fast and secure from the moment they are provisioned.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Runtime">
    **VHB Cloud Runtime** has been optimized for high-density container orchestration, significantly reducing cold start times for serverless-style deployments.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Security">
    **Automatic SSL:** Every deployment now receives an automated Let's Encrypt SSL certificate. Security is no longer an afterthought; it’s the default.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Networking">
    **Custom Subdomains:** Beta users can now claim and manage their own `*.vectorihub.run` namespaces directly from the dashboard.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## 🛠 Bug Fixes & Refinements

Being in Beta means finding the rough edges. Here is what we've polished in the latest sprint:

  <Accordion title="Environment Variable Parsing" icon="key">
    Fixed a critical issue where hidden `.env` files were not being correctly injected during the container build phase.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Real-time Build Streaming" icon="terminal">
    Improved the socket connection for build logs, providing a smoother, zero-latency stream during the **Analyze** and **Build** steps.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 🏗 Roadmap: What's Next?

We are just getting started. Here is the trajectory for the next few weeks:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Deploying Nested folders">
    Introduction of a dedicated binary for terminal-based deployments, secret management, and log tailing.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Zero time deployments">
    Deploy closer to your users with choices between US-East, EU-West, and Asia-Pacific clusters.
  </Step>
</Steps>
