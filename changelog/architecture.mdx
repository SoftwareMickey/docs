## The Problem

Traditional deployment platforms cause downtime during container rebuilds.
For developers, this breaks user experience and trust.

## Our Approach at VectorIHub

At Beaver, we designed a rebuild pipeline that:
- Regenerates images
- Uses rolling container replacement
- Maintains live traffic routing

<Steps>
  <Step title="Upload Code">
    Developer uploads repository to Beaver.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Auto Detection">
    Beaver detects language and framework automatically.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy">
    Container is deployed on VHB Cloud runtime.
  </Step>
